# MasterLara
Fancy a creative meal with all the random ingredients you have at home, however, you are a bit tired to think? 
Join Master Lara to get incredible suggestions and share with friends whatever might be missing.

## How does it work
- Firstly, the user needs to sign-up so we can save their searched information
- With the account set, they can insert every ingredient they have at home, separated by a comma (e.g. carrot, milk, onion. Multiple words are not supported)
- The app will present a list of recipes that matched the search, sorted by best matches
- Each recipe displays the percentage of the ingredients owned by the user vs. ingredients needed in the specific recipe
- In the ingredients list at the recipe detail, the user will see in green what they have, and red whatever is missing
- It's possible to share a message via Whatsapp which will include the name of the recipe and a list of missing ingredients, so anyone can join!
- Each user can save their favorite meal to a recipe book associated with their account
